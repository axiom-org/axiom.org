```bash
axiom alloc [bucketName] [providerID]
```

Allocates a bucket to a particular provider.

Usually you don't have to run this command because
[create-bucket](#docs-cli-axiom-create-bucket) allocates a bucket for you.  This is useful if there is a specific set of providers that
you would like to use.

This command is a synonym of [axiom
allocate](#docs-cli-axiom-allocate) for those who prefer to avoid typing.
