                <p>
                  The core Axiom blockchain is replicated many times, but stores
                  only the most critical data. Storage buckets are replicated
                  fewer times and store general application data. So in most
                  cases, users can interact with your decentralized application
                  without paying for expensive transactions.
                </p>

                  Both the static application bundle and user data are available
                  via JavaScript API. A decentralized application can be run
                  with a Chrome extension, or through a static mirror. So you
                  can't censor an application by blocking a single URL.

                  control to allow the application to write to a single storage
                  bucket. At any time, the user can revoke control and delegate
                  to a different application.

            <h4>
              <strong>Q.</strong> How do I build an Axiom app?
            </h4>
            <p>
              The architecture for an Axiom app is similar to the{" "}
              <a href="https://jamstack.org/">JAM stack</a>. The application
              logic lives in static HTML and JavaScript. Dynamic user data can
              be accessed at runtime through the JavaScript Axiom client.
            </p>
            <p>
              You can start out with your favorite frontend framework, like
              React, Angular, or Vue. Or you can just start writing a plain old
              HTML page. Once you have a site that's working locally, you can
              use the Axiom CLI to deploy it as a decentralized application. You
              can then access it using the Chrome extension, or anyone can
              mirror it to a static site.
            </p>

            <div className="line" />

            <h4>
              <strong>Q.</strong> Why would I want to build an Axiom app?
            </h4>
            <p>
              Our mission is to increase freedom on the internet. Axiom lets you
              build an app that cannot be blocked by a single hosting provider,
              or a centralized authority blocking a single URL.
            </p>
            <p>
              There is also a second, sneakier form of censorship. Sometimes a
              platform arises that claims to be committed to free speech. But it
              is still controlled by a single, centralized entity. Over time,
              that entity comes under pressure from advertisers and politicians,
              and decides to introduce censorship. With an Axiom application,
              users control their data, so they can decide to keep their old
              data while moving to a different application provider. Axiom helps
              application developers commit to staying open.
            </p>
            <p>
              Finally, like most other cryptocurrencies Axiom generates new
              valuable tokens over time through a "mining" model. Some of these
              tokens are paid to machines running application storage, and some
              of these tokens are paid out to application developers. So you can
              make money directly by making a popular Axiom application.
            </p>

            <div className="line" />

            <h4>
              <strong>Q.</strong> How much money can I make?
            </h4>
            <p>
              Right now, Axiom is in beta. We don't expect the tokens to be
              worth anything until the main network launches. However,
              applications built on Axiom will continue to work when the main
              network launches. User accounts and user data created on the beta
              network will be airdropped into the main network. So you can start
              building decentralized applications now, with some hope of getting
              paid later.
            </p>

            <div className="line" />

            <h4>
              <strong>Q.</strong> Can I make money mining?
            </h4>
            <p>
              Yes, although we think it is confusing to call it "mining". It is
              more accurate to call it "hosting". The network needs machines
              that store both application data and user data, and rewards
              machines that perform this storage with cryptocurrency tokens.
            </p>
            <p>
              In particular, Axiom is not a "proof-of-work" cryptocurrency. It
              uses the{" "}
              <a href="https://www.stellar.org/papers/stellar-consensus-protocol.pdf">
                Stellar Consensus Protocol
              </a>{" "}
              for the core operation of its blockchain. The upside of this style
              of consensus protocol is that the blockchain can operate much more
              efficiently. This means that very few computing resources need to
              be expended to gain consensus on blocks, so the primary cost of
              operating the network is the cost of file hosting.
            </p>
            <p>
              The downside of this style of consensus protocol is that it is
              less censorship-resistant. We think this is the right tradeoff to
              make, because blockchain efficiency is a requirement to make
              decentralized applications cheap enough to be usable.
